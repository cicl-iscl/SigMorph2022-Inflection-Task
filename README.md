# SigMorph2022-Inflection-Task
This paper describes our participation in the 2022 SIGMORPHON-UniMorph Shared Task
on Typologically Diverse and AcquisitionInspired Morphological Inflection Generation.
We present two approaches: one being a modification of the neural baseline encoder-decoder
model, the other being hand-coded morphological analyzers using finite-state tools (FST)
and outside linguistic knowledge. 

While our proposed modification of the baseline encoderdecoder model underperforms the baseline for
almost all languages, the FST methods outperform other systems in the respective languages by a large margin. 
This confirms that purely data-driven approaches have not yet reached the maturity to replace trained linguists 
for documentation and analysis especially considering low-resource and endangered languages.
